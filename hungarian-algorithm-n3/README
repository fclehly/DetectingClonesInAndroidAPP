𝓞(n³) implementation of the Hungarian algorithm,
also known as the Hungarian method, Kuhn–Munkres
algorithm or Munkres assignment.

The Hungarian algorithm solves the minmum bipartite
matching problem in 𝓞(n⁴). By implementing the priority
queue with a van Emde Boas tree the time can be
reduced to 𝓞(n³ log log n). The van Emde Boas tree
is possible to use because the elements values are
bounded within the priority queue's capacity.
However this implemention achives 𝓞(n³) by not using
a priority queue.

Edmonds and Karp, and independently Tomizawa, has
also reduced the time complexity to 𝓞(n³), but I
do not known how.
